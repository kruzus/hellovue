      I wanted to make something with Vue so I decided to make something simple.
      But my main go to frontend lib is React. I do like Vue, but something
      about feels extra, I don't know what it is but there is something extra
      lingering around. With React you just encapsulate your view and logic into
      a function. That simple.
